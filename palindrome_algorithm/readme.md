# Palindrome Algorithm
This Section covers the implementation of algorithms for popular palindrome problems

## Palindrome Permutation
`time complexity`: The time complexity for this implementation of the palindrome permutation is O(n).

`how it works`: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Possible palindrome checks if a sentence is a palindrome or not, this is accomplisehd by running through the entire word or sentence(which would be a string). If the number of reoccuring character is greater than one, then it is infact not a palindrome. However, if the reoccuring charaters are 0 or 1, that means that if the word or sentence is flipped bakcward, the spelling will remain the same, hence, it is a palindriome.
